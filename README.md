- 👋 Hi, I’m @fcorreia3
- 👀 I’m interested in using the power of data visualization to communicate complex phenomena in order to promote informed decisions by all. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about UI/UX and geospatial data. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, JavaScript and I am open to learn about fields that push my goals forward.  
- ✨ My github portfolio is in the beauty spa to be prettified, excuse any mess you may encounter.
